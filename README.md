#### Blurb:
  I recently bought this Bushnell Voyager Sky Tour 900mm x 4.5" Reflector Telescope at a garage sale for **$5** and it is missing a couple things. One of them is the dial for precise horizontal adjustment. I could could fix this by throwing money at it for replacement parts, or I could engineer my own, and add functionality that would otherwise be impossible. 
Here's the plan:
- Prototype alignment system with Arduino and Servos
- 3D Print dial and Arduino attachment point
- lksdjflksdf

I thought this could make a super fun project that would allow me to apply my knowledge of Arduino circuits and coding, learn about telescopes, and upgrade mine for cheap!

## Projects
### Arduino Telescope Upgrade
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Freewing
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
